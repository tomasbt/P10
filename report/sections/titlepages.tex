}{% the abstract
  In this report a fast high precision stereo vision engine for implementation on a FPGA is studied. Different aspects of stereo vision are explored. Two stereo vision algorithms: \textit{Efficient Edge Preserving Stereo Matching} and \textit{Fast Cost-Volume Matching} have been studied and implemented in Python. A discussion concerning the algorithms results in the choice of \textit{Fast Cost-Volume} for further implementation. A description of Gajski-Kuhn Y-chart follows with a discussion of pros and cons. Then implementation techniques are described and parts of the algorithm is implemented. In the conclusion it is discussed whether a fast high precision stereo vision engine is possible using the given specifications and the chosen algorithm.
