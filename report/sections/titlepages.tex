}{% the abstract
In this report, a fast high-precision stereo vision engine for implementation on an FPGA is studied. Different aspects of stereo vision and obstacles within this area are explored. Two stereo vision algorithms: \textit{Efficient Edge Preserving Stereo Matching} and \textit{Fast Cost-Volume Matching} have been studied and implemented in Python. A discussion concerning the algorithms computational complexity and stereo matching quality results in the choice of \textit{Efficient Edge Preserving Stereo Matching} for further implementation. A final implementation was not achieved but the challenges of implementing an exponential function and the challenges with memory usage with large images were studied and solutions were found.
