\section{Occlusions}
Examples of occlusions:\\~\\

Implicit detection is when occlusions are handled while matching. Explicit detection is when the occlusions are detected by matching both ways. Currently the algorithm use explicit matching.  \\

Types of occlusions:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Border occlusions
  \item Non-border occlusions
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Partial occlusion
    \item Self occlusion
    \item Total occlusion
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Math:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item $p_L$: occluded point
  \item $q_L$: neighboring points
  \item $l_{P_L}(q_L)$: disparity of $q_L$
  \item $\hat{l_{P_L}(p_L)}$: disparity of occluded found by interpolation
  \item $w_{q_L}$: the likelihood of $p_L$ with $q_L$
  \item $i(p_L)$: intensity of $p_L$  
  \item $\bar{I}(p_L)$: mean intensity of $p_L$
  \item $\mu _L$: decay rate
  \item $F$ is the matrix of coordinates of all the control points 
  \item $L$ is the vector of their corresponding labels.  
  \item $w$ is the weight vector
  \item $F_w = diag(w)F$
  \item $L_w = diag(w)L$ 
  \item $P$ is the parameter vector $P = [a\quad b\quad c]'$
  \item $E(p_L)$ the diffusion energy
  \item $\mathcal{N}(p_L)$: set of non-occluded neighbors of $p_L$ 
  \item $l_{p_{Lf}}$ disparity of the horizontal closest non-occluded point to the right of $p_L$. Expected to be part of foreground, f for foreground
  \item $l_{p_{Lb}}$: disparity of the horizontal closest non-occluded point to the left of $p_L$. Expected to be part of background, b for background
  \item $\Delta I$: absolute difference
  \item $\mu ^{-1}$: variance of $\Delta I $
  \item $\zeta$: Normalizing factor
  \item $\alpha$: exponential distribution
  \item $P(\Delta I)$: mixture probability model
  \item $H(p_L,q_L)$: Homogeneity
  \item $\psi$: cut-off function
  \item $D(p_L,\mathcal{N}_i(p_L))$: average truncated color distance
  \item $S_0$ background surface
